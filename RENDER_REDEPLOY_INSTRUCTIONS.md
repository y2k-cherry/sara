# üöÄ RENDER REDEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS - CRITICAL FIXES

## Overview
All critical Sara issues have been fixed and pushed to GitHub. Now you need to redeploy on Render to get the fixes live.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed
1. **Agreement Generation**: Now extracts all fields properly from messages
2. **Email Purpose Recognition**: Now recognizes verbatim content and custom subjects
3. **Google Sheets Authentication**: OAuth working for payment queries

## üîÑ How to Redeploy on Render

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy (Recommended)
If you have auto-deploy enabled on Render:
1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your Sara service
3. The deployment should start automatically since we pushed to `main` branch
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
If auto-deploy is not enabled:
1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your Sara service
3. Click the "Manual Deploy" button
4. Select "Deploy latest commit" 
5. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 3: Force Redeploy
If you need to force a fresh deployment:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your Sara service
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Scroll down and click "Manual Deploy"
5. Choose "Clear build cache & deploy"

## üîç How to Verify the Deployment

### 1. Check Deployment Logs
In your Render dashboard:
- Look for these success messages in the logs:
  ```
  ‚úÖ Direct Sheets Service initialized
  ‚úÖ Slack app initialized successfully
  ‚úÖ Slack event handlers registered
  ```

### 2. Test the Fixed Functionality
Once deployed, test these in Slack:

**Agreement Test:**
```
@Sara generate an agreement for Bloome, Legal name: PRAGATI KIRIT JAIN, Address: 12A,Plot 8A33, A-WING, Harsha Apartments, Hardevibai Society, Ashok Road, Little Angels Play Group, Jogeshwari East, Mumbai, Maharashtra, 400060. Deposit: Rs 10,000, Fee: Rs.320. Field: Fashion & accessories
```
**Expected**: Should generate agreement without asking for missing fields

**Email Test:**
```
@Sara send email to yash@cherryapp.in saying 'Hello' and subject is 'HI'
```
**Expected**: Should show email preview with subject "HI" and body containing "Hello"

**Sheets Test:**
```
@Sara who hasn't paid
```
**Expected**: Should return list of brands with outstanding payments

## üö® If Deployment Fails

### Check Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Render:
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` 
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

### Check Build Logs
Look for any Python import errors or missing dependencies in the build logs.

### Restart Service
If needed, you can restart the service:
1. Go to your service in Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
