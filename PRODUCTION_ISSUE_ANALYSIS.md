# Production Issue Analysis - Agreement Generator

## Current Status
🔍 **Issue**: Sara asks for details already provided in the Bulbul message
✅ **Local Testing**: Works perfectly - all fields extracted correctly
❌ **Production**: Still failing after deployment
🚀 **Debug Logging**: Enhanced logging deployed to production

## Key Discovery
Our local testing shows that **everything works perfectly** when using the exact same code and message format that's deployed to production. This means the issue is **environment-specific**.

### Local Test Results (Working)
```
🎯 Detected intent: generate_agreement ✅
🔍 DEBUG: OpenAI API call completed in 2.36 seconds ✅
🔍 DEBUG: Final extracted data: {
  'brand_name': 'Bulbul',
  'company_name': 'MED FASHIONS PRIVATE LIMITED', 
  'company_address': 'B/H PREM CONDUCTOR, 858, GUJARAT...',
  'industry': 'clothing and fashion',
  'flat_fee': '300',
  'deposit': '5000',
  'deposit_in_words': 'five thousand'
} ✅
🔍 DEBUG: Missing fields: [] ✅
```

## Likely Production Issues

### 1. OpenAI API Problems in Production
- **Rate limiting**: Production might be hitting OpenAI rate limits
- **API key issues**: Different API key or quota exhausted in production
- **Timeout issues**: Production environment might have shorter timeouts
- **Network issues**: Render might have connectivity issues to OpenAI

### 2. Environment Variable Issues
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Might be missing or incorrect in Render
- **Different key**: Production might be using a different OpenAI key with different limits

### 3. Memory/Resource Constraints
- **Memory limits**: Render free tier might be running out of memory
- **CPU limits**: Processing might be getting killed due to resource constraints

## Next Steps - Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Check Render Logs
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your Sara service
3. Click on "Logs"
4. Try the Bulbul message again in Slack
5. Look for these debug messages:
   ```
   🔍 AGREEMENT DEBUG: Message contains 'agreement'
   🔍 AGREEMENT DEBUG: Intent classification result: generate_agreement
   🔍 DEBUG: OpenAI API key present: True
   🔍 DEBUG: OpenAI API call completed in X.XX seconds
   ```

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables in Render
1. Go to Render dashboard → Your service → Environment
2. Verify these variables exist:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
3. Check if `OPENAI_API_KEY` starts with `sk-` and is the correct length

### Step 3: Test OpenAI API in Production
If the logs show OpenAI API issues, the problem is likely:
- **Rate limiting**: Your OpenAI account hit usage limits
- **Invalid key**: The key in Render is different/expired
- **Network issues**: Render can't reach OpenAI

## What to Look For in Logs

### ✅ Good Signs (Working)
```
🔍 AGREEMENT DEBUG: Intent classification result: generate_agreement
🔍 DEBUG: OpenAI API call completed in 2.36 seconds
🔍 DEBUG: Final extracted data: {...}
🔍 DEBUG: Missing fields: []
```

### ❌ Bad Signs (Failing)
```
🔍 DEBUG: OpenAI API key present: False
🔍 DEBUG: OpenAI API call failed: [error message]
🔍 DEBUG: Using fallback manual extraction
🔍 DEBUG: Missing fields: ['company_name', 'company_address', ...]
```

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Restart Render Service
Sometimes environment variables don't load properly:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Test again

### Fix 2: Check OpenAI Account
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. Check if you've hit usage limits
3. Check if your API key is still valid

### Fix 3: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure your Render environment has the correct `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Expected Resolution
Once we identify the specific production issue from the logs, we can:
1. Fix the environment variable if missing
2. Handle rate limiting with better error messages
3. Add retry logic for network issues
4. Upgrade Render plan if resource-constrained

The code itself is working perfectly - this is purely an environment/configuration issue.
