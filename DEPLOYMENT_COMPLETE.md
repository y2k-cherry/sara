## 🔄 Render Auto-Deployment Status

Since your Render service is connected to the GitHub repository, the deployment should automatically trigger within 1-2 minutes of the Git push.

### Expected Render Deployment Process:
1. **Trigger**: Automatic deployment triggered by Git push ✅
2. **Build**: Render will pull latest code and install dependencies
3. **Deploy**: New version will be deployed to production
4. **Health Check**: Service will restart and be available

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

Once Render deployment completes, test these scenarios:

### 1. Service Status Feature
```
@Sara service status
```
**Expected**: Comprehensive health report showing all 11 services

### 2. Payment Query Fix
```
@Sara who hasn't paid
```
**Expected**: List of brands with outstanding payments

### 3. Help Command Update
```
@Sara help
```
**Expected**: Help message now includes service status feature

## 📊 Monitoring Deployment

You can monitor the deployment progress at:
- **Render Dashboard**: Check your Sara service deployment logs
- **Slack**: Sara will send a restart notification when deployment completes
- **Health Endpoint**: `https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com/health`

## 🔍 Deployment Verification

The deployment includes these critical fixes:
- ✅ Service status intent classification (moved to PRIORITY 1)
- ✅ OpenAI client initialization error resolution
- ✅ Production HTTP orchestrator updated with all features
- ✅ Enhanced pattern matching for payment queries
- ✅ Comprehensive service monitoring capabilities

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Wait for Render deployment** (usually 2-5 minutes)
2. **Test the fixed functionality** in Slack
3. **Monitor service health** using the new status feature
4. **Verify all existing features** still work correctly

The fixes are now live and should resolve both the service status and payment query issues you experienced.
