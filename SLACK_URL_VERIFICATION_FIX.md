# üîß Slack URL Verification Fix Guide

## üéØ **Current Issue**
Your Sara bot is deployed successfully on Render, but Slack's Event Subscriptions URL verification is failing with "Your request URL responded with an HTTP error."

## ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Wait for Render Deployment**
1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your "sara" service
3. Wait for the latest deployment to complete (should show green ‚úÖ)
4. Your app URL: `https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com`

### **Step 2: Test Your Endpoints**
Before configuring Slack, verify your endpoints are working:

**Test the health endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Sara Bot",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-29T07:49:03.123456",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

**Test the Slack events endpoint (GET):**
```bash
curl https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com/slack/events
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "Slack events endpoint is working",
  "method": "GET",
  "slack_handler_initialized": true,
  "slack_app_initialized": true
}
```

### **Step 3: Configure Slack Event Subscriptions**

1. **Go to your Slack App settings:**
   - Visit: https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Select your "Sara" app

2. **Navigate to Event Subscriptions:**
   - Click "Event Subscriptions" in the left sidebar
   - Make sure "Enable Events" is turned ON

3. **Update the Request URL:**
   - In the "Request URL" field, enter:
     ```
     https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com/slack/events
     ```
   - Click outside the field or press Tab
   - Wait for Slack to verify the URL

4. **Expected Success:**
   - You should see a green checkmark ‚úÖ
   - Message: "Verified"

### **Step 4: Configure Bot Events**
Make sure these events are subscribed under "Subscribe to bot events":
- `app_mention` - When someone mentions @Sara
- `message.channels` - Messages in channels (for thread replies)
- `message.groups` - Messages in private channels
- `message.im` - Direct messages

### **Step 5: Save Changes**
- Click "Save Changes" at the bottom
- Slack will ask you to reinstall the app to your workspace
- Click "Reinstall App"

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **If URL Verification Still Fails:**

1. **Check Render Logs:**
   - Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Logs
   - Look for challenge verification messages
   - Should see: `‚úÖ Slack challenge received: [challenge_string]`

2. **Test with curl:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com/slack/events \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"challenge": "test_challenge"}'
   ```
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {"challenge": "test_challenge"}
   ```

3. **Check Environment Variables:**
   - In Render dashboard ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Environment
   - Verify these are set:
     - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (starts with `xoxb-`)
     - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

**Issue: "HTTP Error" in Slack**
- **Cause**: App not fully deployed or crashed
- **Solution**: Check Render logs, ensure deployment is successful

**Issue: "Challenge parameter not found"**
- **Cause**: Request not reaching the endpoint
- **Solution**: Verify URL is exactly `https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com/slack/events`

**Issue: "Timeout"**
- **Cause**: Render free tier cold start
- **Solution**: Visit your app URL first to wake it up, then retry verification

## üéâ **Success Indicators**

When everything is working correctly:

1. **Slack Event Subscriptions page shows:**
   - ‚úÖ Request URL: Verified
   - Green checkmark next to your URL

2. **Render logs show:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Slack app initialized successfully
   ‚úÖ Direct Sheets Service initialized
   ‚úÖ Slack event handlers registered
   ‚úÖ Slack challenge received: [challenge_string]
   ```

3. **Test in Slack:**
   - Type `@Sara help` in any channel
   - Sara should respond with the help message

## üöÄ **Next Steps After URL Verification**

Once URL verification succeeds:

1. **Test Sara's functionality:**
   - `@Sara help` - Should show help menu
   - `@Sara who hasn't paid?` - Should check brand balances
   - `@Sara generate agreement for Test Company` - Should create agreement

2. **Set up additional features:**
   - Email functionality (requires EMAIL_PASSWORD in environment)
   - Google Sheets access (OAuth already configured)

## üìû **If You Still Need Help**

If the URL verification continues to fail after following these steps:

1. **Share the exact error message** from Slack
2. **Share Render logs** from the time you tried verification
3. **Confirm your app URL** is accessible via browser

The most common issue is simply waiting for the Render deployment to complete. Make sure you see the green checkmark in your Render dashboard before attempting Slack URL verification.
