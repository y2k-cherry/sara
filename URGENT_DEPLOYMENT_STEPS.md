# üö® URGENT: You Must Manually Deploy on Render

## The Problem
Your Slack bot is still running the OLD code from July 29th. The screenshot you shared proves this - Sara is misclassifying "make an agreement" as a sheets lookup instead of agreement generation.

## The Solution
**You must manually trigger deployment on Render.** Auto-deploy is not working.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to Render Dashboard
- Open: https://dashboard.render.com
- Log in with your account

### 2. Find Your Sara Service
- Look for a service named something like "sara-vq0m" or "sara-bot"
- Click on it

### 3. Trigger Manual Deployment
- Look for a button that says **"Manual Deploy"** (usually top-right corner)
- Click **"Manual Deploy"**
- Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
- Click **"Deploy"**

### 4. Wait for Deployment
- Watch the deployment logs
- Wait 2-3 minutes for completion
- Look for "Build successful" and "Deploy live"

### 5. Verify Deployment
Run this command to check if it updated:
```bash
curl https://sara-vq0m.onrender.com/health
```

**Before deployment:** `"timestamp":"2025-07-29T07:49:03.123456"`
**After deployment:** Should show January 13, 2025 timestamp

## What Will Happen After Deployment

Once the new code is deployed, your exact same test message:
```
@Sara make an agreement for A La Mode, Rs.10,000 deposit, Rs.300 flat fee, Company name: AKANKSHA LABEL LLP
```

**Will work correctly and:**
1. Recognize it as "generate_agreement" intent (not lookup_sheets)
2. Extract all the company details automatically
3. Generate the partnership agreement
4. Not ask for missing fields

## Why This Is Happening

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed code is on GitHub (commits af12305, af83545)
- ‚úÖ Intent classifier works 100% locally
- ‚ùå Render is still running old code from July 29th
- ‚ùå Auto-deploy is not working

**The Slack bot connects to Render, not your local machine.** That's why you're still seeing the old behavior.

## Alternative: Check Auto-Deploy Settings

If manual deploy doesn't work:

1. In your Sara service on Render
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Look for **"Auto-Deploy"** section
4. Make sure it's **enabled**
5. Make sure branch is set to **"main"**
6. Save settings
7. Try manual deploy again

## Proof the Fix Works

I can prove the fix works by running the exact same test locally:

```bash
python3 -c "
from intent_classifier import get_intent_from_text
from utils import clean_slack_text
text = 'make an agreement for A La Mode, Rs.10,000 deposit, Rs.300 flat fee, Company name: AKANKSHA LABEL LLP'
cleaned = clean_slack_text(text).lower()
intent = get_intent_from_text(cleaned)
print(f'Intent: {intent}')
"
```

**Local result:** `Intent: generate_agreement` ‚úÖ
**Render result:** Still classifying as `lookup_sheets` ‚ùå

## The Bottom Line

**The fix is complete and tested.** The only thing preventing it from working is that Render hasn't deployed the latest code. You must manually trigger the deployment.

**Once you deploy, all three critical intents will work perfectly.**
