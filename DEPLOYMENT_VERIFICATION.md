# Deployment Verification - Email Pipe Character Fix

## Issue
Sara's email extraction was appending "|displayname" to email addresses due to Slack's email link formatting.

## Fix Applied
Added email cleaning logic in `email_service.py`:
```python
# Clean up email address - remove Slack display name formatting (email|displayname)
if recipient_email and '|' in recipient_email:
    recipient_email = recipient_email.split('|')[0].strip()
```

## Local Testing Results
✅ All tests pass locally:
- Plain format: "vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in" → "vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in"
- Pipe format: "vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in|vipasha" → "vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in"

## Deployment Status
- Commit: c8ed4fb - "Fix Slack email pipe character formatting issue"
- Pushed to GitHub: ✅
- Render Auto-Deploy: Pending verification

## Expected Result
After deployment, Sara should extract clean email addresses without the "|displayname" suffix.

## Test Case
Message: "@Sara send an email to vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in saying Hi"
Expected: Email preview should show "**To:** vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in" (without "|vipasha")
