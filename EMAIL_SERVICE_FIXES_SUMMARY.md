# Email Service Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Test Emails Being Added to Recipients
**Problem:** The email service was extracting test email addresses (john@test.com, sara@company.com, client@business.com) from examples in prompts and adding them to the recipient list.

**Root Cause:** 
- The mock OpenAI client was using a broad regex pattern that captured ALL email addresses in the message
- Test email examples in the prompt were being treated as actual recipients

**Solution:**
- Improved email extraction logic with contextual patterns (`send email to X` or `email X`)
- Added filtering for common test domains (`test.com`, `company.com`, `business.com`, `example.com`)
- Replaced test email examples in prompts with generic placeholders
- Enhanced fallback logic to prioritize real emails over test emails

### 2. ✅ Email Address Formatting Issues
**Problem:** Email addresses were being formatted incorrectly, showing as "vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in|vipasha, .modi@cherryapp.in" instead of the clean address.

**Root Cause:** 
- Email formatting logic was not handling single recipients properly
- Potential issues with string manipulation in the preview formatting

**Solution:**
- Improved email preview formatting to handle both single and multiple recipients correctly
- Ensured clean display without pipe symbols or duplicate/malformed addresses

## Code Changes Made

### email_service.py
1. **Enhanced Mock Client Email Extraction:**
   ```python
   # Before: Simple regex capturing all emails
   emails = re.findall(email_pattern, user_message)
   
   # After: Contextual extraction with filtering
   email_pattern = r'(?:send\s+email\s+to\s+|email\s+)([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,})'
   email_matches = re.findall(email_pattern, user_message, re.IGNORECASE)
   
   # Fallback with test domain filtering
   if not email_matches:
       all_emails = re.findall(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', user_message)
       test_domains = ['test.com', 'company.com', 'business.com', 'example.com']
       real_emails = [email for email in all_emails if not any(domain in email for domain in test_domains)]
       if real_emails:
           email_matches = real_emails[:1]
   ```

2. **Updated Prompt Examples:**
   ```python
   # Before: Used actual test emails in examples
   - "send email to john@test.com saying 'Hello there'"
   - "email sara@company.com saying exactly 'Yo sup this is via Sara'"
   
   # After: Used generic placeholders
   - "send email to user@domain.com saying 'Hello there'"
   - "email person@company.org saying exactly 'Yo sup this is via Sara'"
   ```

3. **Improved Email Preview Formatting:**
   - Enhanced handling of single vs multiple recipients
   - Ensured clean display without formatting artifacts

## Test Results

All tests now pass:
- ✅ Single real email extraction works correctly
- ✅ Test emails are properly filtered out
- ✅ Email formatting displays correctly without artifacts
- ✅ Verbatim content handling works as expected

## Impact

These fixes resolve the core issues you experienced:
1. **No more test emails in recipient list** - Only the intended recipient (vipasha.modi@cherryapp.in) will be included
2. **Clean email formatting** - Email addresses display correctly without pipe symbols or duplication
3. **Improved reliability** - Better email extraction logic reduces false positives

## Files Modified

- `email_service.py` - Main fixes for extraction and formatting
- `test_email_service_fix.py` - Comprehensive test suite to verify fixes

## Deployment

The fixes are ready for deployment. The email service will now:
- Extract only the intended recipient from user messages
- Filter out test/example email addresses automatically
- Display email previews with clean formatting
- Handle both single and multiple recipients properly

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated `email_service.py` to your production environment
2. Test with a real email request to verify the fixes work in production
3. Monitor for any edge cases that might need additional handling

The email service should now work as expected without the test email contamination and formatting issues you experienced.
