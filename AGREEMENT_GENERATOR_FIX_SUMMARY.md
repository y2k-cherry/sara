# 🔧 Agreement Generator Fix - Complete

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **Field Extraction Problem**
- **Issue**: Bot was asking for "flat_fee" even when provided in message
- **Cause**: Regex pattern didn't handle semicolon separator in "Flat Fee; Rs.320"
- **Fix**: Updated regex patterns to handle various separators (`:`, `;`, spaces)

### **Mock OpenAI Client Improvements**
- **Enhanced**: Better fallback parsing when OpenAI API fails
- **Added**: More robust regex patterns for all field types
- **Improved**: Error handling and field extraction reliability

### **DirectSheetsService Robustness**
- **Fixed**: Initialization errors that could cause fallback issues
- **Enhanced**: Better error messages and graceful degradation
- **Improved**: Payment query pattern matching
