# Email Extraction Improvement Summary

## Issue Identified
Sara was failing to extract email addresses from user messages, even when they were clearly specified. The user reported that Sara responded with "I couldn't find the recipient's email address" when asked to send an email to `yash@cherryapp.in`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The original email extraction regex pattern was too restrictive:
```python
recipient_match = re.search(r'(?:to|email)\s+([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,})', message_text, re.IGNORECASE)
```

This pattern only matched "to [email]" or "email [email]" with no words in between, but failed on messages like:
- "@Sara send an email to yash@cherryapp.in saying Hello"

## Solution Implemented
Improved the email extraction logic with multiple robust patterns:

### Pattern 1: "to [email]" (with possible words in between)
```python
pattern1 = re.search(r'to\s+(?:\w+\s+)*([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,})', message_text, re.IGNORECASE)
```

### Pattern 2: "email [email]" (with possible words in between)
```python
pattern2 = re.search(r'email\s+(?:\w+\s+)*([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,})', message_text, re.IGNORECASE)
```

### Pattern 3: Any email address in the message (fallback)
```python
pattern3 = re.search(r'([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,})', message_text, re.IGNORECASE)
```

## Testing Results
All test cases now pass successfully:

✅ **Test 1**: "@Sara send an email to yash@cherryapp.in saying Hello"
- Email: yash@cherryapp.in ✅
- Purpose: Hello ✅

✅ **Test 2**: "send email to john@example.com about the meeting"
- Email: john@example.com ✅
- Purpose: the meeting ✅

✅ **Test 3**: "email sarah@company.com saying Thanks for your help"
- Email: sarah@company.com ✅
- Purpose: Thanks for your help ✅

✅ **Test 4**: "send an email to team@startup.io regarding the project update"
- Email: team@startup.io ✅
- Purpose: the project update ✅

## Files Modified
- `email_service.py` - Improved `extract_email_details()` method with robust regex patterns
- `test_email_extraction_fix.py` - Created comprehensive test suite
- `test_specific_message.py` - Created specific test for the reported issue

## Deployment Status
Ready for deployment to Render. The improved email extraction logic will now correctly identify email addresses in various message formats, resolving the issue where Sara couldn't find clearly specified email addresses.

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes email extraction failures
- ✅ Supports multiple message formats
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Improves user experience with email functionality
